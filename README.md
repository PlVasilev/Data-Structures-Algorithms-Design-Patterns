## Design Patterns

### Creational
01. AbstractFactory - Creates an instance of several families of classes
02. Builder - Separates object construction from its representation
03. FactoryMethod - Creates an instance of several derived classes
04. Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned
05. Singleton - A class of which only a single instance can exist

### Structural
01. Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes
02. Bridge - Separates an objectâ€™s interface from its implementation
03. Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects
04. Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically
05. Facade - A single class that represents an entire subsystem
06. Flyweight - A fine-grained instance used for efficient sharing
07. Proxy - An object representing another object

### Behavioral
1. Chain of Resp. - A way of passing a request between a chain of objects
2. Command - Encapsulate a command request as an object
3. Interpreter - A way to include language elements in a program
4. Iterator	- Sequentially access the elements of a collection
5. Mediator	- Defines simplified communication between classes
6. Memento - Capture and restore an object's internal state
7. Observer	- A way of notifying change to a number of classes
8. State - Alter an object's behavior when its state changes
9. Strategy	- Encapsulates an algorithm inside a class
10. Template Method	- Defer the exact steps of an algorithm to a subclass
11. Visitor	- Defines a new operation to a class without change
